# TrapHD
This is an initial repository for next generation Trap system. The code included validates:
1-the CSI MIPI camera. 
2-SDCARD read, write and erase.
3-QSPI Flash read, write and erase.
4-the functionality of the LPSI flash(to be used for JPEG image/user data): Read, WRITE, ERASE.

Image compression is tested on MCUXpresso, and it is working as expected: compressed image data are saved into an SD card.
